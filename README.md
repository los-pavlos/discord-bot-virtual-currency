## Installation

### Install the Required Packages

Install the necessary dependencies using the following commands in your project directory:

```bash
dotnet add package DSharpPlus
dotnet add package DSharpPlus.CommandsNext
dotnet add package dotenv.net
dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.Sqlite
dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json
```

### Setting Up the Bot

Create a .env file in the root of the project directory.

In the .env file, add your Discord bot token:

``
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_token_here
``
Replace your_discord_token_here with your actual Discord bot token.

Make sure your bot has the necessary permissions on your Discord server (sending messages, reading message history, etc.).

### Running the Bot
After youâ€™ve set up your .env file and installed the dependencies, you can run the bot using:

```bash
dotnet run
``` 
This will start the bot and it will connect to Discord. The bot should now be online and ready to interact with users in your Discord server.

### Database
The bot uses SQLite to store user balances, lottery entries, and other game-related data. The database file (players.db) will be automatically created in the project directory. If the database does not exist, it will be created upon running the bot for the first time.
